# Secure Messaging Application

This is the Gitlab repository for the Secure Messaging project for **group 16**

First, setup the server to generate the certificate and public key by running
`python3 server/server.py`
(this pathing is to ensure the client end can locate the certificant and publick key)
When the server application prompt for a passphrase, enter "passphrase" (without quotations) and hit enter, the server would finish setup and start listing to events.

Once the server is up and running, create a client instance by running
`python3 client/client.py`
You can create multiple client instances for testing purposes.
